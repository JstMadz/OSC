# 1.2 Computer-System Organization
A general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a bus. The bus provides access between components and shared memory.

 Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device. Depending on the controller, it may be connected to mulitple devices. For example, a USB controller may have multiple USB ports attached to it.

A device controller maintains local buffer storage and a set of special-purpose registers. The device controller is responsible for moving the data between the peripheral devices it controls and the local buffer storage.

OS usually have a device driver for each device controller. This device driver understands the device controller operation and provides the rest of the OS with a uniform and well-defined interface to the device.

The CPU and device controllers can execute in parallel. To ensure orderly access to memory, a memory controller is present to synchronize access to the memory storage.
