# HDD Scheduling

Using HDDs efficiently entails minimizing access time and maximizing data
transfer bandwidth.

A process may request an IO operation using a system call. This request may
contain the following parameters:

1. Input or output operation?
2. The file handle to operate on.
3. The memory address of the data buffer.
4. The amount of data to transfer.

##  First Come First Serve (FCFS)

A queue of requests is served using chronological ordering of the requests. This
algorithm is intrinsically fair but does not perform very well.

## SCAN Algorithm

The disk arm starts at one end of the disk and moves toward the other end,
servicing each request that it encounters its desired cylinder.

Whenever the arm reaches the other end, it will reverse its direction going
back. This is problematic since if we assume uniform distribution of requests,
the parts that are close to the second end have just been serviced and it's not
likely that there will be lots of requests there again.

## C-SCAN Algorithm

Just like the SCAN algorithm. However, when it reaches one end, the arm goes
back to the end where it started. Hence the name (circular SCAN).

## Selection of a Scheduling Algorithm

Linux uses the _deadline_ disk scheduling algorithm, which maintains two queues
for reads and writes, and gives the read queue priority (since processes are
more likely to block on reads than writes). For each queue, it implements
C-SCAN.
