# 2.2 User and OS Interface

## 2.2.1 Command Interpreters
Command interpreters are usually called _shells_. In Unix systems, a user can choose from different shells, such as __C shell, Bash, Korn shell__, and many others. Users can write their custom shells.

Shells can operate in two main schemes. One way is to implement commands in the shell code, so that when a user types in a command, the shell program jumps to a code portion of its own that handles that command.

The second and the most commonly used way is to have a lightweight shell code that only tries to detect the place of programs called and load them into memory. This way new commands can be added by just _developing_ CLI applications that handle those commands.
